# Hey there, i'm Andy 👋🏼

I'm a self taught coder specializing in JS/CSS/HTML.  Webapps are my jam... but i love some database construction too.  Up to this point i've worked on fantasy football related projects, but am looking to expand!  

### Current Projects:
- https://FantasyMocks.com/ - a webapp for (dynasty) fantasy football mocks & collecting ADP.
