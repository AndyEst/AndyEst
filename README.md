# Hey there, i'm Andy 👋🏼

I'm a self taught dev specializing in JS/CSS/HTML.  Webapps & database construction are my jam.  Personal projects are NFL/fantasy football related at the moment.  

### Current Projects:
- https://FantasyMocks.com/ - a webapp for (dynasty) fantasy football mocks & collecting ADP.
